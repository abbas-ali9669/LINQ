        // It is a part of the language but not a complete language.
        // Linq is developed by Microsoft and is available in System.Linq namespace.
        // LINQ is a uniform query syntax which can be applied on different data sources.
        // LINQ offers a compact, expressive, and intelligible syntax for manipulating data.
        // LINQ was introduced in .NET Framework 3.5 and C# 3.0.

        // By using LINQ we can communicate with various data sources without learning the specific query.
        // No need to learn a new quary languages for different data sources.
        // Less code as compare to traditional approach.
        // Compile time safety.
        // Intellisense support.
        // Has alots of in built methods to support different operations.
        // If you are a C#, VB.Net develper (Web, Mobile, Console, chatbot etc), then you must learn LINQ.
